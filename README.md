iSleep is an independent watchOS application designed to help users monitor and improve their sleep quality by tracking snoring patterns and breathing during sleep, without requiring a companion iPhone app.

## Features

- üé§ Real-time snoring detection using the Apple Watch microphone
- ü´Å Breathing pattern analysis throughout the night
- üì≥ Optional haptic feedback to help reduce snoring
- ‚öôÔ∏è Customizable sensitivity settings for snoring detection
- üîí Privacy-focused with all processing done on-device
- üì± Independent watchOS app - no iPhone required
- üíæ Local storage for enhanced privacy and offline access
- üìä 7-day sleep history with detailed analytics
- üéµ Audio playback of recorded snoring events

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **AudioRecordingService**: Handles real-time audio processing using AVFoundation
- **SleepSession**: Data model for tracking sleep metrics and events
- **ContentView**: SwiftUI-based user interface with sleep tracking controls
- **PersistenceController**: Manages local CoreData storage
- **AudioManager**: Handles local audio file storage and retrieval
- **CalendarView**: Displays 7-day sleep history with interactive calendar

### Key Technologies
- SwiftUI for the user interface
- AVFoundation for audio processing
- WatchKit for device-specific features
- Background audio mode for continuous tracking
- CoreData for local data persistence
- App Groups for Watch/iOS data sharing

## Privacy & Security

iSleep takes your privacy seriously:
- All audio processing is done locally on your Apple Watch
- No audio is recorded or stored
- No data is sent to external servers
- Microphone access is only used during active sleep tracking sessions
- Required permissions are handled directly on the Watch
- All data is stored locally on your devices
- No cloud services or external dependencies

## Requirements

- watchOS 8.7 or later
